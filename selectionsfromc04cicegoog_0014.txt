INTRODUCTION.

1. Writing materials. - In early times the Romans
used for their letters thin tablets of wood or ivory
(tabellae) smeared with wax (cera), through which they
scratched (exarare) the characters with the stilus. This

was of metal or ivory, sharpened at one end for writ-
ing, and having the other end rounded for erasure

, (vertere stilum). The tablets were surrounded by a

raised rim, like that of the modern schoolboy’s slate‚
which served to keep the waxed suriaces apart when
two or more tablets were fastened together. To secure
the letter from molestation, the tabellae were tied to-
gether by means of a thread (linum) passing through
holes in the center, and the knot was sealed with wax
and pressed with the signet ring (ursulus). Inasmuch
as letters were often dictated to an amanuensis, this seal
(ragnum) was the proof of genuineness, and the thread
was therefore cut that the seal might be kept intact
(see Cic. in Cat. 3. 5. 10, where the image of a distin-
guished ancestor is used as the seal). Cicero himself
preferred to write to his intimates with his own hand,
but was often forced by circumstances to resort to dicta-
tion (IX.*). In Art. 6. 6. 4 Cicero boasts of his forgery
of a letter, which he dictated to a secretary of the sup·
posed writer to insure belief in its genuineness.
