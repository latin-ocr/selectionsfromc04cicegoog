2. Ancient papea—We know that many of Cicero's
letters were written on the tablets described above, but
lor the longer letters paper (charta) made from the
papyrus plant was used. Pliny the Elder is our chief
authority for the manufacture of the chartae. The pith
oi the reed was cut into thin strips; these were laid
side by side, and covered transversely ⁴with a similar
layer. They were then wet with water, and perhaps
with paste‚ pressed or hammered into a single sheet,
and made smooth by pollshing. The size oi the charta
depended upon the distance between successive joints
of the papyrus reed. For writing on this substance, a
pen (calmum) of reed, very like the quill pen of modern
times, was used. The ink (atramentum) was made ot
soot and gum, or from the juice of the cuttle-fish, and
¹ was thick like the ink of the Chinese. It could be
removed with a sponge (spongia), and the charta thus
cleaned was called a palimpsestas. In Fam. 7. 18. 2
Cicero asks Trebatius what writing could have been so
worthless as to be replaced by the latter’s letter.

3. The transmission ot letters—There was no gov-
ernment post in the time of Cicero, and the letter writer
had to depend for the delivery of his letters upon mes-
sengers (tabellarii) in his service or in the service of a
friend, the messengers of the sarmers oi taxes (publi-
cani), the orderlies (statores) of the officials of the prov-
inces, or the kindness ot those who happened to be
going in the right direction. The messengers covered
from thirty-five to forty-five miles a day on land, and

Ι by sea, from five to seven knots an. hour. In Fam. 14.
