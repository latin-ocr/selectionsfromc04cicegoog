sometimes shortened to salntem (Sal. or 5.), and some·
times omitted altogether. The formality of the greet-
ing varied with the intimacy of the correspondents.
We find the praenomen alone (xlv), cognomen alone
(XX L), praenomen and cognomen, praenomen and nomen

(XXXVIII.), and all three (IV.) A very formal greet-
ing contained, as in the last example, the full names of

both persons with their titles, if they held office, and the
praenomina of their fathers ¹sometimes of their grand-⁴
fathers also. In correspondence with members of his
own household, Cicero used less regular forms (XIII.,
XXVIII.). The greeting was sometimes followed by

stereotyped expressions oi interest in the health and wel· ' ,
fare of the person addressed (111, IV., XLV„ XLVIII.‚ · Ι

L.). There was greater variety in the forms oi affec·
tionate or considerate farewell; cf. Coro nt valeas
(xli), Cnra nt valeas et me, nt amos, ama (XXI.),
Vale (XXXV.)

5. The collections of Cicero’s letters. ——Of the letters
oi Cicero’s correspondence there have come down to
us nearly nine hundred in all, oi which about four hun-
dred are ¹Epistulae ad Α tticum, a somewhat larger num-
ber Epistulae ad Familiares so called, and the remainder
ad Qnintnm Fratrem and orl Brntnm. The greater col-
lections are divided into sixteen books each, the Epist.
· od Qnint. Frot. into three, and the Epist. ad Brut. into
two. Nearly one hundred of the letteis are from other
than Cicero’s hand; among the writers are Cato, D.
Brutus M. BrutuS, Cassius, Pompey, Caesar, Asinius
Pollio, Lepidus, and other famous men ol the time.
