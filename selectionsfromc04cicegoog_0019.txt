12 INTRODUCTION.

‚ ures. Another modern title, ad Diuersos, is not Latin.
This collection seems to have been known to the an· 1
cients as simply Epistularum Libri Sedecim, and the

individual books bore the names of those to whom the ,

first letters in each were addressed (I., od Lentulum ,-
II., ad Curionem ,· VIII„ M. Caeli Epistulae ad M. Τ ul· ’
lium Ciceronem). We have in Nepos’ life of Atticus
(16. 3) a reference to the Epist. ad Aru, and the proba-
ble reading points to the collection of sixteen books as
it has come down to us; but of the other letters known
to the ancients half seem to have been lost. Among
them were three books ad Caesarem and four ad Pom-
peium. The extant collection ad Fam. is supposed to
= be an early and incomplete edition.

7. Atticus. -That the Epist. od Art. are more valua-
ble than the Epist. od Fam. is due not more to the con·
tinuity and regularity of the correspondence than to the
intimacy existing between Atticus and Cicero, and the
consequent frankness of the latter in writing of political
matters T. Pomponius Atticus was well-born, cultured,
and in possession of a fortune which enabled him to
speculate in business enterprises of a novel sort, as well
as in recognized wayS, while preserving his position as
gentleman of leisure and patron of literature. He held
himself steadfastly alooi from political life, living abroad
a great part of the time, and managed to keep the favor
of the prominent men of all factions. He had great
business sagacity, and acted frequently in matters of
business as Cicero's agent. Cicero deferred to his judg-

ment in literary matters also.
